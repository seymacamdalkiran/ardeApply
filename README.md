Hello,

I am considering applying for the SOFTWARE TESTING SPECIALIST position among your job listings.

However, I would like to bring to your attention a noticeable issue. When I click on the apply button for all listings, I am redirected to the GERMAN-Speaking SOFTWARE TESTER position regardless of the other positions I choose.

I believe this might be a mistake. When applying for different positions, I expect to receive the appropriate results matching the title of the position I have applied for.

Furthermore, it is my responsibility to ensure that errors are rectified before going live and to perform my job to the best of my abilities. As a software test specialist, I strive to achieve quality-oriented and error-free results with my extensive experience and strong technical knowledge. Humbly speaking, my confidence as a test specialist and my professional approach reinforce my belief that I can contribute to your company's goals.

Thank you, and I appreciate your attention in advance.

Best regards,

Seyma DalkÄ±ran
